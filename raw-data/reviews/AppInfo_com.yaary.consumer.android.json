        "I downloaded the app from the play store, but I was very disappointed with its performance. The app is not working properly at all. Every time I open the app, it keeps loading to get my current location, even though I have turned on the location GPS. This is very frustrating and annoying. I think the app developers should fix this bug as soon as possible, or else I will uninstall the app and give it a one-star rating",
        "Kudos to the yaary app team . Overall great experience using this app although i noticed some issues using the app which i hope gets fixed asap - 1. Driver location is not accurate 2.Ride fare before and after the ride isn't same 3. Map shows incorrect directions 4. Change the vehicle icon for better visibility Apart from this i'll suggest to keep an option for the user to give his own ride fare price before booking a ride",
        "This app is a disappointment. It's very bad, charging extra fees beyond the estimated price. Moreover, the customer service is painfully slow, making problem resolution a frustrating experience. Overall, I do not recommend this app.",
        "Please do not force to turn on GPS signal. Try asking 2-3 times post which let users manually enter pickup and drop locations. Turning ON GPS drains away battery and all other apps like Ola/Uber/Rapido do not force users to turn on GPS to book a ride. Hence please implement the same.",
        "Great work. We need your app, this service. Problems I had after installing the app, (you guys would be working on this): it not taking the destination location, also when I zooming to pin the location it is skipping a bit, after pining location it's only waiting and not proceeding... My mobile is Moto e4 plus"
