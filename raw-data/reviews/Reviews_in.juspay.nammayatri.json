        "text": "excellent app. however if we go by shorter route, it will not change the fare. even after escalation it was not resolved. If we are going to Bannerghatta road from malkesgwaram it shows fare via nice road with toll, there is no option to choose straight route. Also if you extend your journey, fare will not get updated. If you shorten the trip also fare will not get updated. These drawbacks to be addressed immediately. Don't say sorry, contact support. Just work on this. Charge on actual kms run."

Trice now I was stuck in an unknown location because in the last moment the drop location changes and because of this I have to pay twice the amount to reach my original destination. The customer care for this app is also trash they never resolve any issue leaving you with almost no option but to lose money. As someone new to the city the experience gets worse everytime."

But few days back in KR puram when I booked auto through namma yatri there were other people who were asking namma yatri auto driver why are you receiving requests through namma yatri , they told us not to book auto through namma yatri. And whenever we book auto through ola , uber they cancel the booking and asking the same rate offline. Why this much scams? That to in KR puram it's very high. Why police and RTO don't talk about it."

The next ride after two days was a pleasant surprise with the auto turning up at the right time. It was a brand new and clean auto and the driver was very polite too. What I observed while booking is, unless you accept paying an additional tip of Rs.10 or 20 booking never happens."

Now I do not have any reason to book from your app. I'd like this reviewed and bring back the old option."

The problem here is that the drivers say that they are on their way or they will be there in some time but then after they make you wait for a long time they cancel. This is annoying and very very inconvenient. I would suggest to impose cancellation fee if any party cancels after 2 mins of booking."

While booking the fare amout will be something else and after the ride, the gate amount will be double. I've been cheated by the long routes and extra fare multiple times and thier customer support is not of any help. They take days to even refund 15rs or reply to a complaint. There are many other apps better than this. Please don't use this and ruin your day"
