Also, if not following the map, consent has to be taken for toll and additional charges. This is also a safety issue for women passengers if the driver rides in a different route."

Hi team, You are the worst service provider I have ever seen. I booked a ride with a cost of Rs.139/- to my office which is near silkboard. But your driver dropped in somewhere else from there I hv take one more ride which costs me 90+. I am not going to use service and I ll also inform my followers(1k) to not use your bloody service. Scoundrels idiots."

You will book a ride, fare will show 300, then when you are dropped it will 400. The reason they will tell you is that the ride was longer. This is some joke. Even the drivers know this thats why they are doing this. They are deliberately taking longer routes and charging way way more. This does not happen in Ola, Uber, Rapido. DON'T BOOK FROM THIS APP. I have suffered enough."

Fare should be fixed and approx estimate is a cheating. So I'm reducing the rating from 5 to 1. It's profitable only for drivers not for passengers."

The problem here is that the drivers say that they are on their way or they will be there in some time but then after they make you wait for a long time they cancel. This is annoying and very very inconvenient. I would suggest to impose cancellation fee if any party cancels after 2 mins of booking."
