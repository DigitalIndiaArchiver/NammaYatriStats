        "text": "If there is an option of 0 stars then better use my review for that. It's a pathetic app. None of the drivers accept the booking. I have been trying like crazy for many days ultimately go for Rapido or Ola. They are far better. You will think the rides are cheaper compared to Ola but Not at all. Driver will never accept the bookings. Rather they have added the feature of 10, 20, 30 rs tip if u use your ride fare will be more than Ola that too no guarantee of bookings. Better look for other apps"

Fare should be fixed and approx estimate is a cheating. So I'm reducing the rating from 5 to 1. It's profitable only for drivers not for passengers."

        "text": "The most horrible auto app under the sun. U will find the most rude and aggressive drivers here who behave like goons and can abuse u verbally and physically. The customer care doesnt take any actions against such drivers. There is absolutely no safety for girls. The drivers will start abusing vulgarly in the street n u wont be able to do anything bcoz the customer support will not be of any help. It's an app made by and made of goons. Why ask for our contact details wen u dont want to rectify"

Worst service, their drivers never pickup a ride during the peak hours and when we most needed them. I waited for 40 minutes on the app booking in the midst of rainy night not a single auto rick was booked. All glitz no substance in the name of startups and customer easement."

Ola and uber is far more better, they value their customer. This app is mainly for scammy drivers who are money hungry"
